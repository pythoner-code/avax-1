## Deploying Your EVM Subnet Using Avalanche CLI

To deploy your EVM subnet using the Avalanche CLI, follow these steps:

1. Install Avalanche CLI if you haven't already. You can find the installation instructions [here](https://docs.avax.network/build/tutorials/platform/create-a-blockchain-subnet-with-avalanche-cli).

2. Set up your EVM subnet configuration according to your requirements.

3. Use the Avalanche CLI commands to deploy your EVM subnet.

## Adding Your Subnet to Metamask

To add your subnet to Metamask, follow these steps:

1. Open Metamask in your browser.

2. Click on the network selection dropdown at the top of the Metamask extension.

3. Select "Custom RPC".

4. Enter the network details for your deployed EVM subnet, including the RPC URL, chain ID, symbol, and block explorer URL.

5. Click "Save" to add the custom network.

## Making Sure It Is Your Selected Network in Metamask

Before proceeding, ensure that your deployed EVM subnet is selected as the active network in Metamask. You can verify this by checking the network name displayed in the top right corner of the Metamask extension.

## Connecting Remix to Your Metamask

To connect Remix to your Metamask, follow these steps:

1. Open Remix in your browser.

2. Click on the settings icon (gear icon) on the Remix sidebar.

3. Under the "Plugin" section, select "Solidity Compiler".

4. Scroll down to the "Deploy & run transactions" section and select "Injected Web3" as the environment.

5. Remix will automatically connect to your Metamask account.

## Deploying the Smart Contracts

Using Remix and Metamask, deploy your smart contracts to your EVM subnet. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and funds to deploy contracts.

## Testing Your Application

Once your smart contracts are deployed, you can test your application. Use Remix to interact with your deployed smart contracts, deploy tokens, pools, and more. Verify that your application functions as expected on the deployed EVM subnet.
